# This workflow will trigger Datadog Synthetic tests within your Datadog organisation
# For more information on running Synthetic tests within your GitHub workflows see: https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/cicd_integrations/github_actions/

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# To get started:

# 1. Add your Datadog API (DD_API_KEY) and Application Key (DD_APP_KEY) as secrets to your GitHub repository. For more information, see: https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/.
# 2. Start using the action within your workflow

name: Run Datadog Synthetic tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Run Synthetic tests within your GitHub workflow.

  with:

    # The Go version to download (if necessary) and use. Supports semver spec and ranges.

    go-version: # optional

    # Path to the go.mod or go.work file.

    go-version-file: # optional

    # Set this option to true if you want the action to always check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec

    check-latest: # optional

    # Used to pull node distributions from go-versions. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting.

    token: # optional, default is ${{ github.server_url == 'https://github.com' && github.token || '' }}

    # Used to specify whether caching is needed. Set to true, if you'd like to enable caching.

    cache: # optional, default is true

    # Used to specify the path to a dependency file - go.sum

    cache-dependency-path: # optional

    # Target architecture for Go to use. Examples: x86, x64. Will use system architecture by default.

    architecture: # optional
